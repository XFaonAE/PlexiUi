## Welcome
Let's get started by installing PlexiUi, as of now, to install this framework you must clone the repository to your project root.
In the future we will create an installer that will add PlexiUi to an existing project ready to use.
It will even allow you to update the framework's components.

Enough into, let's dig in!

## Installation
Run the following command in a folder with all of your projects:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AxeriDev/PlexiUi
```
Now we need to install all the dependencies with the following command:
```bash
npm install
```

That's it, your project is ready for use!

## Basic Example
Let's start the framework in development mode using one of the pre created scripts
```bash
npm run app:dev
```
Some activity will take place until the window opens with a default application
